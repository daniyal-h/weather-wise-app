# Iteration 1 Retrospective

**What went well:**  
Iteration 1 was completed on time; the first feature was to bring up the immediate weather of any entered city. Improvements and alterations were also made to the user stories. For example, the original feature was to only show Winnipeg's weather as a default. This was changed to implement a search bar to allow any city to be forecasted. The version control across the user stories was majorly fulfilled, completing all tasks within the milestone due date.

**What didn't go well:**  
While all tasks were accomplished, it did reveal the unnecessary dev tasks originally planned. Many were planned poorly, with too much overlap and an incorrect forecast of the time to complete them. I found myself deleting a handful of entire branches of these dev tasks, having done nothing on them as I had already completed their goals in another. This was not from overdoing; rather, it was from failing to divide user stories into distinct and mostly disjoint tasks. Another problem that stuck out was my merging tactics. I was initially squash-and-merging every pull request. Later, I would realize just how much history was being lost. Since branches were deleted (outside of Main and Development), the few squashed commits in Development at the end hid the overarching branching strategy. While it is still possible to check these individual squashes, merging the Development purely and only squash for the working version to the Main branch would have been better.

**What could be improved:**  
The main thing I wanted to improve was being more agile. I found myself quite one-way with my coding. I made the plan and worked to finish it, never going back to alter the plan. This proved to be a mistake, with many branches ending up unused and deleted. Committing merges is also something to build on, preserving history better; Development should reveal the branching strategy while Main should remain minimal with squashed merges.

**New thoughts to add to Iteration 2:**
 - Revamp the search to a drop-down that spans stored major cities
 - Write the search code such that it allows ease-of-update for future additions to stored cities
