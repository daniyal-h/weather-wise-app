									<h2 class="major">PROJECT POSTMORTEM</h2>
									<p><strong>What went right?</strong><br>
										The app finished better than planned. The original immediate-weather showcasing for a few hundred cities was entirely overhauled to 
										support over 126,000 cities, alongside five-day forecasting with near-instant results. Beyond that, the development panned out well: 
										features were added iteratively, delivering working version every time, and on time. Agile additions were incorporated in the latter two 
										iterations, allowing the app to gradually grow while correcting the mistakes from the iteration one.
									<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>
										Many points throughout revealed the poor planning at the start. As this was my first project, there were things I did not plan for well or at
										all. Many dev-tasks were estimated incorrectly and/or planned inadequately with too much overlap with one another, leading to 
										redundancies. Testing the program also showcased errors with the database being in internal storage and instrumented tests overwriting 
										the original save from its built-in clean-up procedures, pointing towards a non-ACID database. Another problem was that the search 
										feature is restricted: only unique cities within a country are allowed. This reduced the true support cities count from over 200,000 down to 
										126,000. 
									</p>
									<p><strong>What took the most time?</strong><br>
										Feature two, implementing the search and favouriting feature, took the most time. It began by implementing a database, starting from its
										designing and conversion to SQLite. The logic to weave together the presentation layer with the data layer was tedious. Finding proper 
										data for the search to reference was also time-consuming; I began with 500 major cities, having the database helper return a cursor for 
										every change in the search bar. Small edges cases existed that were resulting in empty or null calls, but were fixed later. Building on the 
										database interaction saw updates to the database. This required updated to the database design and demanded more effort to fulfill. 
										One such was adding a population column to each city entry to refine search beyond simple, alphabetical order. Finding updated 
										population numbers to match to every city in the database proved difficult, and was accounted for by iteration 3.
									</p>
									<p><strong>How did the project change?</strong><br>
										The original offline-support feature was forgone to be replaced by extended forecasting. It was decided that offline support, for most 
										users, was not a priority; free wi-fi is becoming increasingly prevalent alongside cellular data, rendering offline weather support fairly
										obsolete. Setting aside time for the quality-of-life update with extended forecasting was definitely worthwhile and beneficial for the app.
